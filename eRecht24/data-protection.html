<h1>Data protection declaration</h1>

<h2>Data privacy</h2>

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration.

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) are raised, this takes place, as far as possible, always on voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.



<h2>Cookies</h2>
Some of the Internet pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies serve to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website.

You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.



<h2>Server log files</h2>
The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

<ul>
<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
<li>operating system used</li>
<li>referrer URL</li>
<li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
<li>Time of the server request</li>
</ul>

This information cannot be assigned to specific individuals. This data is not combined with other data sources. We reserve the right to check this information subsequently if we become aware of any concrete indications of illegal use.

<h2>Contact form</h2>
If you send us enquiries using the contact form, your details from the enquiry form, including the contact data you provided there, will be stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event of follow-up questions. We will not pass on this data without your consent.

<h2>SSL encoding</h2>
This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests you send to us as a site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.



<h2>Right to information, deletion, blocking</h2>
You have the right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of data processing as well as the right to correct, block or delete this data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint if you have any further questions on the subject of personal data.



<h2>Contradiction advertising mails</h2>
We herewith object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation to send unsolicited advertising and information material. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information, such as spam e-mails.
