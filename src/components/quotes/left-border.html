      Discipline in typography is a prime virtue. Individuality
      must be secured by means that are rational. Distinction
      needs to be won by simplicity and restraint. It is equally
      true that these qualities need to be infused wiht a
      certain spirit and vitality, or they degenerate into
      dullness and mediocrity.
